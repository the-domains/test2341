So tired of people claiming Hillary is a Republican. She's not.

<article style=""><h1>Hillary Clinton Was Liberal. Hillary Clinton Is Liberal.</h1><p>A bunch of reporters have recently discovered a shocking truth: Hillary Clinton is liberal! (I heard a rumor that Columbo has been helping with the investigation.) We've gotten this raft of "Clinton is liberal" expos√©s as Clinton has revved up her 2016 campaign, speaking out in support of gay marriage, a pathway to citizenship for immigrants in the U.S.</p><img src="https://espnfivethirtyeight.files.wordpress.com/2015/05/85357740.jpg?w=1200" /></article>
